# Task 6

## A message
I worked very hard to finish the project on time, but the time given was not enough for such a complex and challenging task. I had to do a lot of research, documentation, coding and simulations in WOkWI and tinkercad, which took more time than I anticipated. I also faced some problems with the lack of simulation parts in tinkercad, which forced me to find another software (WOKWI), and the fact that I wanted to add a gif image to latex to make explanation easier. I did my best to overcome these obstacles and work as fast as possible, but I could not make it before the deadline. I hope I can finish the task completely before I get a disappointing feedback. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜Š
